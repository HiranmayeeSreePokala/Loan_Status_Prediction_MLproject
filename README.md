## Objective

The idea behind this ML project is to build an ML model and web application that the bank can use to classify if a user can be granted a loan or not.

## About Data

The dataset contains information about Loan Applicants. There are 12 independent columns and 1 dependent column. This dataset includes attributes like Loan ID, gender, if the loan applicant is married or not, the level of education, applicant’s income etc.

To load the training data in your colab, use the below command:

```bash
loan_dataset = pd.read_csv('Load Data.csv')
```
